:mod:`lab_yaml` -- YAML Parsing
=========================================

LAB_YAML Learning Objective: Learn to parse a YAML file using the PyYAML library
                             and use the information.
::

 a. Start with your code (or the solution code) from lab_multi.

 b. Replace the command line config parsing with a YAML config parsing function.  Use the first
    argument to the program as the config file to parse.

 c. Create a YAML file that contains the same config items as the old command line.  Verify you
    can configure the program by changing the config file options.
